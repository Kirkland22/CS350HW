1) Test and Survey both are able to create,display,save,load,modified,taken,tabulated and for test only, grade.

2) Basic error checking completed.

3) If a survey/test is created and you wanna keep it, select save before you do anything else.

4) When asked to enter an answer, It expects A,B,C..(or a,b,c doesn't matter) etc or 1,2,3... For Short Answer and Essay, User can input whatever they like.

5) One Test is already created in the "test" folder and one Survey is created in the "survey" folder.

6) The "Take" Feature:
   - When a user takes a survey/test, they are asked for there name/userID/whatever and it is saved in the survey_taken/test_taken folder (although I don't think we need to save each survey since you cant grade them).

7) The "Grade" Feature:
   - When a admin wants to grade, they get a list of possible test to grade. The format will be TestName_UserWhoTookTest.
   - They can then choice which user to grade and it will display the grade
   - Example : Grade = 10/10 with 0 left to be graded manually.

8) Tabulation:
   -  Tabulated works but the tabulation for matching could look much better. I don't really have time to fix it until later.
   -  Left Column is gonna be the choices, Right Column is how many times it was chosen.
